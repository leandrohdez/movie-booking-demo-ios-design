# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Booking (demo)

Developed example inspired by the design [Cinema Application](https://dribbble.com/shots/14435913-Cinema-Application?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=helenas&utm_content=Cinema%20Application&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=helenas&utm_content=Cinema%20Application&utm_medium=Social_Share) by [Helena](https://dribbble.com/helenas). I take this opportunity to congratulate Helena for the excellent work.

## SOLID Principles
The development of the project was carried out based on the principles of single responsibility of high cohesion and low coupling, collected as SOLID principles of software engineering. 

## Architecture
Designed in a multilayer architecture, which constitutes an object-oriented system organized in several layers or levels. Each of these layers or levels contains a set of classes with responsibilities related to the layer to which they belong.  

## Architecture pattern
To take advantage of these advantages, I have relied on the SwiftUI language for the implementation of the presentation layer, as well as the architecture pattern: **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** that allowed me to exploit its full potential.
